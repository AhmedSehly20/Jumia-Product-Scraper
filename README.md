# Jumia Product Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape product information from Jumia, including product name, price range, ratings, company name, and product image URL. It then saves the scraped data to a CSV file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required libraries by running:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script directly.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

```
python jumia_scraper.py

```

4. Provide the URL of the Jumia product page you want to scrape when prompted.

5. The script will display the scraped data and save it to a CSV file named `jumia_product.csv`.
